Subworld Library Unofficial Mod Patch (SLUMP)

This mod patches Subworld Library by adding additional functionality and potential fixes to improve the multiplayer experience of subworlds.

Currently the mod contains 2 server-sided patches which may improve stability in multiplayer:

1) Write Loop Thread.
- Seperates the Main Thread and sub/main server Read Loop Thread by adding an additional communication layer.
- Bypasses blocking writes on the main thread.
- Reduces the chance of servers deadlocking.
- Reduces potential communication slowdowns on the main server.
- May increase total packet latency for clients connected to a sub-server.

2) Packet Filter.
- Adds a packet filter to the incoming communication.
- Intentionally blocks/drops packets a client is not allowed to send during certain stages of the login process.
- Reduces the chance of random disconnects or 'infinite loading screens' when going between servers.
- Bypasses 'bootplayer' code.

The individual patches can be enabled/disabled in the mod config. Some might need a reload!

If you encounter any problems, please post them on the workshop page.
